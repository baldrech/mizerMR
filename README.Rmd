This extension package for mizer allows you to work with multiple
size-structured resources in the same way in which you work with multiple
species in mizer.

# Installation

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("sizespectrum/mizerMR")
library(mizerMR)
```


# Setting up a model with multiple resources

Multiple size-structured resources are set up in a very similar manner to
multiple species. Just as for multiple species we need a `species_params` data
frame with the information about the species, for multiple resources we need a
`resource_params` data frame, with one row for each resource. Here is an
artificial example with two resources:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tibble)
resource_params <- tribble(
    ~resource,  ~kappa, ~lambda, ~r_pp, ~w_min, ~w_max,
 "Resource 1",    1e11,    2.13,     4,    NA ,   0.01,
 "Resource 2",    1e11,    2.05,    10,   1e-4,     NA
)
```

Similarly to how we can set resource parameters for a single resource in
standard mizer with `setResource()`, you can now set multiple resources with
`setMultipleResources()`. So if for example we wanted to add these resources to
the North Sea model described by the `NS_params` MizerParams object, we would
do

```{r}
params <- setMultipleResources(NS_params, resource_params)
```

This has given us a new MizerParams object in which the original resource has
been replaced by our two resources. We can then work with this MizerParams
object as usual. For example we can project it forward in time:

```{r}
sim <- project(params, t_max = 2, t_save = 0.2)
```

and plot the resulting spectra:

```{r}
plotSpectra(sim, power = 2)
```

We can also animate the spectra with `animateSpectra(sim)`. Most mizer
functions will work as usual.

We can access the simulation results for the resource with `NResource()`.
This gives a three-dimensional array:

```{r}
str(NResource(sim))
```
So the first dimension is the time, the second the resource and the third 
the size. Thus to get the abundance density of Resource 2 at time 0.6 at
sizes between 0.1g and 5g we could do

```{r}
select_w <- w_full(params) >= 1 & w_full(params) <= 5
NResource(sim)["0.6", "Resource 2", select_w]
```

This is perfectly analogous to how we would access the abundance density
of fish species, except that the range of sizes is given by `w_full` rather
than by `w`.

# More details

Just as we are able to specify how strongly a predator species interacts
with a prey species via the `interaction` matrix, we can also specify how
strongly a predator species interacts with each resource via the
`resource_interaction`, which is a matrix with one row for each species and
one column for each resource. For example

```{r}
resource_interaction <- matrix(runif(24), nrow = 12, ncol = 2)
params <- setMultipleResources(NS_params, resource_params, resource_interaction)
```

Resource parameters can be changed at any time. For example we can double
the carrying capacity of the first resource with

```{r}
resource_params(params)$kappa[1] <- 2 * resource_params(params)$kappa[1]
```

We can also use this kind of notation as an alternative to 
`setMultispeciesParams()`. For example
```{r eval=FALSE}
params <- NS_params
resource_params(params) <- resource_params
resource_interaction(params) <- resource_interaction
```

By default the initial values for the resources will be equal to the carrying
capacities. But if a user has their own array (resource x size) of resource
number densities `my_n_resource` they can set these as the initial values with
```{r eval=FALSE}
initialNResource(params) <- my_n_resource
```

Users who are not happy with the allometric expressions for the resource
carrying capacities or the replenishment rates but have created their own
matrices `my_capacity` and `my_rate` with one row for each resource and one column 
for each size can set these with
```{r eval=FALSE}
resource_capacity(params) <- my_capacity
resource_rate(params) <- my_rate
```

Rather than adding the multiple resources to an existing model, the user can
also create a new model with multiple resources with
```{r eval=FALSE}
params <- newMRParams(species_params, interaction, resource_params,
                      resource_interaction, gear_params)
```
